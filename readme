what is done !!!

* I have made login page in oop fashion
* Created an Guide.php page (logout remaining)
  
  The above page is created on following assumption.The contributors please not this
  while creating databases.

  1) database contains for each users an table with  name = username(there is an catch here which we will discuss).
  2) and each such table contains atleast two columns (which I use in guide.php scripts ,
    
     namely 1) filename  -- stores filename with complete path.
            2) date      -- date at which file was uploaded
  3) reguarding project table , such an table is not needed(but if paul has strong reasons then we can considier ).

  4)Another assumption is that all the project directories are under '/var/projects' directory.and each project directory 
  
Now what I have done is I have finished guide's home page with out 'logout'. logout I will do soon .
 
Add accounts to the Accounts table with atleast one with uname= project name .
then try to login ( there must be users having the same project )
and each user must have an table in his own username and then fileds 'filename' [complete path] and 'date'.

Happy Hacking .
